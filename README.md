Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach - Assignments

Week2 :Predicting house prices

In this module, we focused on using regression to predict a continuous value (house prices) from features of the house (square feet of living space, number of bedrooms,...). We also built an iPython notebook for predicting house prices, using data from King County, USA, the region where the city of Seattle is located.
In this assignment, we are going to build a more accurate regression model for predicting house prices by including more features of the house. In the process, we will also become more familiar with how the Python language can be used for data exploration, data transformations and machine learning. These techniques will be key to building intelligent applications.

Week3:Analyzing product sentiment:

In this module, we focused on classifiers, applying them to analyzing product sentiment, and understanding the types of errors a classifier makes. We also built an exciting IPython notebook for analyzing the sentiment of real product reviews.
In this assignment, we are going to explore this application further, training a sentiment analysis model using a set of key polarizing words, verify the weights learned to each of these words, and compare the results of this simpler classifier with those of the one using all of the words. These techniques will be a core component in your capstone project.

Week4:Retrieving Wikipedia articles

In this module, we focused on using nearest neighbors and clustering to retrieve documents that interest users, by analyzing their text. We explored two document representations: word counts and TF-IDF. We also built an iPython notebook for retrieving articles from Wikipedia about famous people.
In this assignment, we are going to dig deeper into this application, explore the retrieval results for various famous people, and familiarize ourselves with the code needed to build a retrieval system. These techniques will be key to building the intelligent application in your capstone project.
